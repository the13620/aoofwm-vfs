This is the very first public disclosure of the VFS.

As of now, the VFS is still under development and therefore we're not too
big on releasing its full source code, as it's still way too messy, and
changes a hell of a lot very frequently.


However, as the main goals of Aoof-Wm and thus the VFS are portability and
interoperability, we would be glad to hear your comments on the path
we're currently going down for the development.
That's why you'll find here the core API of the VFS, plus a few documents
and notes about its use and development.
Feel free to tap into it and share your comments.

The interfaces shouldn't move that much in a near future as they represent
the smallest common denominator for the target protocols of the VFS.
Protocol-specific functionalities are being designed in abstract classes
inheriting from those interfaces, and are then being implemented according
to each protocol's specifications.
Therefore, those should be quite stable and are eligible to public
consultation.

Thank you and stay tuned,
coming soon, more code is on its way to your screens :-)
