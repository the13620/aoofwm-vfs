--------------------------------------------------------------------------

+ How can I develop a new Resource Driver or Resource type ?


  Resource Drivers are still under development, however you can develop
  a new Resource type by having a look at the 'IResource*' interfaces that
  define the base API for Resources, and you can also have a look at the
  'Resource*' default implementations.
  
  You may also have a quick look at the 'AbstractResource*'
  implementations, which are basically very standard implementations of
  the 'IResource*' to improve code reuse for negligible parts, ensuring
  that you shouldn't have to reinvent the wheel for management code.
